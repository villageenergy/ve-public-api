Trial API access for Customers

The ve-public-api allows Customers to access asset, telemetry and automations associated with their Voltello account. The trial will allow Village Energy to assess the value for Customers of having API access to these services and to explore what additional features and capabilities might be useful for Customers wanting to increase energy automations within their home or business.

Access to the veXAPI is provided via an API key that can be requested using the Customer Support feature. The API key will then be emailed to the Customerâ€™s registered email address. 
The draft API Documentation can be access at https://docs.devices.village.energy/ve-x-api/index.html. 
Support for the veXAPI is limited, although our engineers will be monitoring the public discussion at [insert url].   
We look forward to adding new capabilities based on your feedback.
