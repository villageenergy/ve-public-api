## Trial API access for Customers

The ve-public-api allows Customers to access asset, telemetry and automations associated with their Voltello account. The trial will allow Village Energy to assess the value for Customers of having API access to these services and to explore what additional features and capabilities might be useful for Customers wanting to increase energy automations within their home or business.

The draft API Documentation can be access at [https://docs.devices.village.energy/ve-x-api/index.html](url).

Support for the veXAPI is limited, although our engineers will be monitoring the public discussion. 

## Authorisation

The ve-public-api supports two authorisation methods:

**Context Authorisation:** where the user is granted access to data based on a specific data hierarchy. This access is typical for commercial users of the Voltello IQ platform.

**Customer Authorisation:** where the user is granted access to data and functions that are associated with a Customer. This access is typical for individual Customers and businesses.
